# ECE C147 Project Code

## Introduction

This is the repository that contains all of the code for the ECE C147 Project. The code is maintained by Ethan Keshishian, Matthew Loussinian, and Zachary Wong. 

## Setting up the repo on your device

Here are the steps to setting up the repository on your device:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you include the X data sets, which are too large for GitHub and not included in the repo. There should be two files, `X_test.npy` and `X_train_valid.npy`.
3. Append data files' paths in appropriate code blocks in .ipynb files.

## Overview of our project

The complete report for the project can be found at `ECE 147 Final Project Writeup.pdf`.
